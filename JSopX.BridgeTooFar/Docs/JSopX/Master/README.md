> **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
> 
> This project is currently in **Phase 1** of Development. It **should not** be considered **accurate** or a **release candidate**. In fact, it should be treated as simply reference material for the time being, due to the absolute bare minimum resources created, to satisfy a minimum viable product requirement in Phase 1 (by design). Conversely, Phase 2 is days away, and Phase 3 is only a week after that. Phase 3 Projects will be mature, and action-packed with features, assets, documentation and more!

## Corequisites

﻿
- Ensure we can have a markdown readme like the parent markdown we are in now, and add markdown includes from the child, to see if GitHub supports includes in a way that we need them to.


[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

## Postrequisites

﻿
- Clean and rebuild each project markdown after making changes to ensure includes are properly configured.

## Concomitants

﻿
- You do not need to install technologies mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section just to review the markdown files under `Docs`. However, you will need to if you plan to work with the project in modifying and creating new markdown documents.

## Getting Started

﻿
> [!WARNING]
> This section is just a test. However, it is generally more advanced content.
> 
> **To mimic the advanced cloning of the collective `JSopX.OpenProjectX` project suite, please see, [JSopX.OpenProjectX](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.OpenProjectX) for details.**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

﻿
### Step 1: Create the Parent Basic Markdown Page Template

1. 1. **Create a `BasicMarkdownPage` markdown file**, save it to `Templates`, so we can use it to embed include test markdowns into it.

### Step 2: Create the Child Basic Markdown Page Template Content Includes

2. **Create a `BasicMarkdownPage` directory**, under `Includes/Content/Template`, and create as many static markdown sections needed for this sample.

### Step 3: Double Check the Parent Basic Markdown Page Template for all Includes

1. After adding all `include` blocks in the template, double-check all resources and be sure they exist. 
   
2. If this was done correctly, you should see content added to the live Docs folder.

## Usage

﻿
#### Adding the JSopX™ Bridge Too Far Docs to Other Projects

This is another one of those steps that I did for you, but you never know.

1. **Add Project Reference**:

    - In the solution that requires the common library, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer.
    - Select `Add` > `Reference`.
    - Check the box for `JSopX.BridgeTooFar` and click `OK`.

2. **Use the Common Code**:

    - You can now use the JSopX™ Bridge Too Far Docs from the `JSopX.BridgeTooFar` project in your other projects.


## In Conclusion

﻿
The `JSopX.BridgeTooFar` Project (i.e., _jSilvestri.com BETA v 2024 JSopX™ Bridge Too Far Open Project EXperience_) is one of several, FREE, open-source projects, included in the first-of-its-kind, Multi-Platform, Multi-Stack, `JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection` Enterprise-Level Application.

By centralizing project documents with this approach to mark down will be very helpful, especially with referencing the `JSopX.BridgeTooFar` Read Me docs across projects.
