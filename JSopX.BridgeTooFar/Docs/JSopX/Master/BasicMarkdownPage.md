## Overview

﻿

This guide is an attempt at adding some clarity to reusing Markdown using includes. 



  
> [!CAUTION]
> **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
> 
> This project is currently in **Phase 1** of Development. It **should not** be considered **accurate** or a **release candidate**. In fact, it should be treated as simply reference material for the time being, due to the absolute bare minimum resources created, to satisfy a minimum viable product requirement in Phase 1 (by design). Conversely, Phase 2 is days away, and Phase 3 is only a week after that. Phase 3 Projects will be mature, and action-packed with features, assets, documentation and more!

## Corequisites

﻿

- Ensure we can have a markdown readme like the parent markdown we are in now, and add markdown includes from the child, to see if GitHub supports includes in a way that we need them to.

## Postrequisites

﻿

- Clean and rebuild each project markdown after making changes to ensure includes are properly configured.

## Concomitants

﻿

- As you see more projects being created, pay close attention to the instructions for Git SubTree and Visual Studio Project References. Special considerations had to be made to ensure all projects can be cloned in an `all-in-one` project (e.g., `JSopX.OpenProjectX`) or by independent project isolation for a unique educational user experience not common in most projects.

## Getting Started

> [!WARNING]
> This section is just a test. However, it is generally more advanced content.
> 
> **Please ensure that all test all includes on this page before release.**

## Step-by-Step Instructions

﻿

### Step 1: Create the Parent Basic Markdown Page Template
1. **Create a `BasicMarkdownPage` markdown file**, save it to `Templates`, so we can use it to embed include test markdowns into it.

### Step 2: Create the Child Basic Markdown Page Template Content Includes
2. **Create a `BasicMarkdownPage` directory**, under `Includes/Content/Template`, and create as many static markdown sections needed for this sample.

### Step 3: Double Check the Parent Basic Markdown Page Template for all Includes
1. After adding all `include` blocks in the template, double-check all resources and be sure they exist. 
   
2. If this was done correctly, you should see content added to the live Docs folder.

> **Please ensure that all test all includes on this page before release.**


## In Conclusion

﻿

By centralizing project documents with this approach to mark down will be very helpful.
