> [!WARNING]
> The **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`** (_JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection_) Project requires **over a dozen** technologies in order for all projects and features currently available to work as expected. Please try your best to do your do-dillagence in ensuring your technologies stacks are installed and up-to-date.
This section is to help in that area.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
> 
> This project is currently in **Phase 1** of Development. It **should not** be considered **accurate** or a **release candidate**. In fact, it should be treated as simply reference material for the time being, due to the absolute bare minimum resources created, to satisfy a minimum viable product requirement in Phase 1 (by design). Conversely, Phase 2 is days away, and Phase 3 is only a week after that. Phase 3 Projects will be mature, and action-packed with features, assets, documentation and more!
> 
> Please see [Phase 1 (Current Phase): Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/JSopX/Master/Phases/Phase-1-Minimum-Viable-Product-MVP.md) for more details.

## Corequisites

﻿
- Ensure you are pro-active in at least your own checklist of action items if you do not plan to follow the phases of development. Even setting up Jira, DevOps, or some basic ticket system is better than nothing.

## Postrequisites

﻿
- Clean and rebuild each project after making changes to ensure all changes are working as expected before starting a new phase.

## Concomitants

﻿
- You may need to update Git configurations to handle dependencies between projects. As they app grows, there will be updates to repositories and projects over all that require certain configurations you may or may not be familar with, such as using Git submodules or Git subtree, to ensure all projects can be cloned in an all-in-one project (e.g., `JSopX.OpenProjectX`) or by independent project isolation for a unique educational user experience not common in most projects.
