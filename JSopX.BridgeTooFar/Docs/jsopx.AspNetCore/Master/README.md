> **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
> 
> This project is currently in **Phase 1** of Development. It **should not** be considered **accurate** or a **release candidate**. In fact, it should be treated as simply reference material for the time being, due to the absolute bare minimum resources created, to satisfy a minimum viable product requirement in Phase 1 (by design). Conversely, Phase 2 is days away, and Phase 3 is only a week after that. Phase 3 Projects will be mature, and action-packed with features, assets, documentation and more!

## JSopX.AspNetCore : Project References

What makes the **`JSopX.AspNetCore`** Project—and the entire JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences collection—so versatile, even as an enterprise-level suite, is each project's ability to include and reuse '_Project References_.' These references are shared resources that enhance collaboration and efficiency across projects.

The _Project References_ included in the **`JSopX.AspNetCore`** Project are as follows:


1. [`JSopX.BridgeTooFar`](#jsopxbridgetoofar):
    - A new project being developed, containing base static reusable assets often derived by the primary Shared Resources, Class Libraries and Razor Class Libraries.


## JSopX.AspNetCore : Technology Requirements

Don't forget that the **`JSopX.AspNetCore`** Project requires certain technologies installed to work as expected.
