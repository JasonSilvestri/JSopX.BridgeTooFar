---

[`Home`] » **[`JSopX.OpenProjectX`]**

## Overview

This Governance Model defines how decisions are made, how roles are structured, and how contributions are managed within the JSopX™ ecosystem.

JSopX™ operates with transparency, responsibility, and a focus on long-term engineering stability.

---

## Governance Principles

- **Transparency** — Decisions should be clear, documented, and communicated.  
- **Technical Integrity** — Quality, security, and maintainability are top priorities.  
- **Community Collaboration** — Constructive input is welcomed from all contributors.  
- **Stewardship** — Protecting the JSopX™ architecture, branding, and design standards.
