## **The Primary Business Requirement**

Imagine this: you’re handed a box of mismatched puzzle pieces from ten different puzzles. Some pieces are made of spaghetti (yes, literal spaghetti), and you’re told to make a masterpiece worthy of an enterprise-level gallery. That’s the scenario JSopX™ was built for.  

JSopX™ has several high-stakes business requirements, no doubt. But at its core, it has one unrelenting business requirement above all others: to help developers integrate a chaotic mix of existing applications—each with different tech stacks, coding styles, and standards—into a seamless, unified suite that shares Web APIs, creative assets, and brand standards.  

This isn’t just about unifying applications. It’s about preserving your sanity (well, as much as possible) while wrestling with legacy systems that feel older than time, rogue dependencies that seem to have minds of their own, and the occasional existential crisis triggered by yet another GitHub submodule.  

But let’s be clear—this isn’t just about creating yet another Angular, React, or Vue app that “plays nice” in a unified suite. It’s about addressing the growing imbalance between client-side frameworks and the critical need for robust server-side logic. The dominance of ASP.NET Core across these projects isn’t an accident; it’s a deliberate choice to ensure vulnerabilities, scalability challenges, and maintainability are tackled head-on. After all, a secure, scalable application isn’t just nice to have—it’s the cornerstone of any enterprise-level solution.  

Most importantly, all of this is attainable *and* imperative to deliver on your stakeholders’ perfectly reasonable expectation that their significant investment results in something seamless, powerful, and—dare we say—magical.

### **What’s the Impact?**

Not the path of least resistance, oh no. Instead, I leaned into the chaos, setting up projects that anticipate real-world messes.  

Still, there are some unique considerations that require your attention:  

- **Repository Setup**: Ensure that any developer cloning origin project repositories can do so either as a unified parent Enterprise-Level Application Visual Studio solution (*e.g.*, `JSopX.OpenProjectX.sln`) or as individual child Visual Studio solution projects (*e.g.*, `JSopX.AngularCore.sln`, `JSopX.ReactCore.sln`, etc.) that can run independently from the hive and be ingested incrementally.  
  This atypical implementation required exploring Submodules, Git Trees, and custom Visual Studio `PathConfig.targets` configurations. It works, but it’s not recommended unless mandated.  

- **Client-Side and Server-Side Examples**: These projects reflect real-world quirks and challenges of integrating existing applications, rather than starting fresh with ideal setups.  

- **Shared Resources and Razor Class Libraries**: Designed to unify creative and design standards across the suite.  

- **Centralized Web APIs and Service-Based Projects**: Developed after tackling the initial decentralization challenges.
