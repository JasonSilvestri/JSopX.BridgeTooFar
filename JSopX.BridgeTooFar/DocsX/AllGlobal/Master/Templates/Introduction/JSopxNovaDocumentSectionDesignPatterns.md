## **Overview**  

The following sections are the most common sections found with almost every markdown document. These design patterns includes examples of how each section should appear.  

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Heading Section**

Just about every document should have a valid document heading, which is almost alway the first line of a the document.

**Example for `Document Heading`:**

```
# JSopX™ Documentation
```

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Custom Breadcrumbs Section**

JSopX™ Docs often have `Document Breadcrumb` spots at the top and bottom of most documents. These are custom breadcrumb markdown document formatted breadcrumbs, we try to add to most documents. 

---

### **Common Top Document Breadcrumb**:

Directly _below_ the document heading is often a `Common Top Document Breadcrumb` spot for a custom breadcrumb markdown document format we try to add to most documents, that allows navigation at the **top** of documents, between parent template documents, current active document, as well as the previous and next documents, generally in order in which users should consume each section of the documentation. 

**Example for `Common Top Document Breadcrumb`:**

The following snippet is a `Common Top Document Breadcrumb` (pay close attention to the ``` · · ·  ``` custom separator used between key navigation parts): 

```

---

[`Parent`](#) » **`Active Document`**  · · · [`« Previous`](#) [`Next »`](#)

---

```

**Example for `Common Top Document Breadcrumb` with Comments:**

The following snippet is a `Common Top Document Breadcrumb`, wrapped in a comments sections we are trying to use more and more: 

```

<!-- START of Common Top Document Breadcrumb -->

---

[`Parent`](#) » **`Active Document`**  · · · [`« Previous`](#) [`Next »`](#)

---

<!-- END of Common Top Document Breadcrumb -->

```

We currently do not have comment wrappers around all `Common Top Document Breadcrumb` breadcrumbs, across all documentation. We are working our way there, though, to make it easier for us to find and replace `Common Top Document Breadcrumb` content in the immediate future.

---

### **Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb**:

Directly _above_ the document footer is often a `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb` we try to add to most documents, that allows navigation at the **bottom** of documents, between parent template documents, current active document, back to Top button, as well as the previous and next documents, generally in order in which users should consume each section of the documentation. 

The big difference between the `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb` and `Common Top Document Breadcrumb`, is that the `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb` has a `Back to Top` button.

**Example for `Common Top Document Breadcrumb`:**

The following snippet is a `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb` (pay close attention to the ``` · · ·  ``` custom separator used between key navigation parts):  

```

---

[`Parent`](#) » **`Active Document`**  · · · [`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents) · · · [`« Previous`](#) [`Next »`](#)

---

```

**Example for `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb` with Comments:**

The following snippet is a `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb`, wrapped in a comments sections we are trying to use more and more: 

```

<!-- START of Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb -->

---

[`Parent`](#) » **`Active Document`**  · · · [`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents) · · · [`« Previous`](#) [`Next »`](#)

---

<!-- END of Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb -->

```

We currently do not have comment wrappers around all `Common Bottom Document Breadcrumb` breadcrumbs, across all documentation. We are working our way there, though, to make it easier for us to find and replace `Common Top Document Breadcrumb` content in the immediate future.

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Overview Excerpt Section**

Right below the document heading is a spot for an excerpt from the [Overview](#overview) section if one is currently available. 

**Example for existing `Overview Excerpt`:**

```

By exploring the [Overview](#overview), you’ll understand how each JSopX™ document follows a consistent structural pattern, ensuring clarity and navigability throughout the documentation suite.

```

Otherwise, it will contain a placeholder that needs to be replaced with content. 

**Example for non-existing `Overview Excerpt`:**

```
 Should be an excerpt from [Overview](#overview) section.
```

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Overview Section**

- Introduces the core purpose and context of the document.

**Example for `Overview`:**

```
    ## **Overview**  
	The JSopX™ documentation uses a standardized set of sections across most documents to maintain consistency, simplify navigation, and enhance the learning experience. 

	Rather than piecemealing information, each page follows a familiar blueprint—ranging from introductory overviews and prerequisites to corequisites, postrequisites, and more. 

	This structured approach allows you to quickly orient yourself, identify what’s expected before you begin, understand what complements the content at hand, and anticipate the logical next steps as you progress through the suite.

	[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

	---
```

Otherwise, it will contain a placeholder that needs to be replaced with content. 


**Example for non-existing `Overview`:**

```
 ## **Overview**  
 - Please add some content. 

 [`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

- Installed `.NET 9.0` SDK.
- Installed `Node.js 20.14.0`.

 ## **Corequisites**  

- Basic understanding of `.csproj` and `.sln` file structures.

 [`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

 ---

```


[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Main Content Section** 

Depending on the document, this might detail specific guidelines, examples, or best practices. For clarify, we don't name this section, "_Main Content Section._" It is merely a placeholder for one-to-many potential primary sections.
 
[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Postrequisites Section**
 
Suggests actions or considerations after you’ve absorbed the main content.

**Example for existing `Postrequisites`:**

```
 ## **Postrequisites**  

 After understanding the structure:
 - Revisit earlier documents to quickly locate any information you need, now that you know where to find it.
 - Experiment with applying these structural principles to your own documentation efforts, improving clarity and consistency.
 - Consider how these patterns streamline onboarding and maintenance over the long term.

## **Concomitants Section**

Notes related tools, documents, or techniques that run parallel to the topic at hand.

**Example for existing `Concomitants`:**

```
 ## **Concomitants**  

 As you explore more documents:
 - Remember that the structural sections work in harmony with resources like [Alerts](./Alerts.md) and other JSopX™ guides.
 - Recognize that understanding the layout now prepares you to quickly glean insights from more complex or technical documents later.
 - Treat the structure as a navigational aid that helps you find exactly what you need without unnecessary scrolling or guesswork.

## **In Conclusion Section**

Summarizes key takeaways, reinforcing the document’s overall value.

**Example for existing `In Conclusion`:**

```
 ## **In Conclusion**  

 The standardized sections across JSopX™ documents provide a clear map for your journey. By mastering this layout, you minimize confusion, streamline research, and maximize the value of the guidance offered. In a suite that spans countless technologies and approaches, structure is the anchor that keeps everything coherent.

 ## **Next Steps**  

 1. Proceed to [Jason Silvestri’s Open Project Experiences (JSopX™)](./JasonSilvestriOpenProjectExperiences.md) to see these structural principles applied in a real-world, enterprise-level example.
 2. Review existing JSopX™ documents you’ve already read, applying your newfound understanding of the sections to quickly locate and revisit specific content.

An Include section of common links, copyrights, etc., often found in footer sections globally across documents. 

**Example for existing `Footer`:**

**Example for `Footer` with Comments:**

The following snippet is a `Footer`, wrapped in a comments sections we are trying to use more and more: 

```

<!-- START of Footer -->

<!-- END of Footer -->

```

We currently do not have comment wrappers around all `Footer` sections, across all documentation. We are working our way there, though, to make it easier for us to find and replace `Footer` content in the immediate future.
