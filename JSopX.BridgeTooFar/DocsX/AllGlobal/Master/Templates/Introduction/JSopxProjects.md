## **JSopX™ Visual Studio Projects Available**  

There are over a dozen Visual Studio Projects that make up Jason Silvestri's Open Project EXperiences (JSopX™) Enterprise-Level Application.

### JSopX.OpenProjectX

Jason Silvestri's Open Project EXperiences (JSopX™) is a total FREE, open-source, first-of-its-kind, multi-platform, multi-stack, enterprise-level application. This flagship, homogeneous suite of JSopX™ projects, uses some of the most advanced client-side and server-side technologies of today, such as Asp.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, Angular, React, Node.JS, Vue & more, serving as the main orchestration layer for the entire enterprise-level solution.

### JSopX.AngularCore

A client-side project built with Angular. This project focuses on creating dynamic, single-page applications with Angular, integrating seamlessly with Asp.NET Core server-side, Web API and shared resources.

### JSopX.ReactCore

A client-side project built with React. Similar to `JSopX.AngularCore`, it is used to create dynamic, component-based single-page applications, also integrating seamlessly with Asp.NET Core server-side, Web API and shared resources.

### JSopX.VueCore

A client-side project built with Vue.js, used for creating reactive, component-driven single-page applications, and integrated seamlessly with Asp.NET Core server-side, Web API and shared resources.

### JSopX.AspNetCore

As you may have guessed by now, Asp.NET Core serves as the backend infrastructure for the JSopX™ ecosystem, handling routing, security, authentication, and serving APIs to pages. This particular project, however, is just a server-side project that resembles the client-side SPAs.

### JSopX.BlazorServerCore

A project for creating server-side Blazor applications. Similar to `JSopX.AspNetCore`, but only in look and function. Blazor is a game-changer. This project is focused on building interactive web UIs with Blazor's server-side rendering capabilities.

### JSopX.MauiHybridNetCore

A cross-platform hybrid application using Asp.NET Core, Blazor & .NET MAUI. When razor components are done right, you are given the ultimate desktop, native and web-based technology cross-platform experience distributor.

### JSopX.BridgeTooFar

This project focuses on managing static assets and their distribution across the different client-side and server-side applications. It ensures a clean separation of concerns, particularly around documentation & asset management.

### JSopX.ClassLibrary

A shared library project containing reusable logic, utilities, or components that can be referenced by other projects. This is where you might place common business logic or helper functions.

### JSopX.WebAPI

A project dedicated to building RESTful APIs for the JSopX™ ecosystem. It provides endpoints for various data services and serves as the end-game Web API backend for all  the server-side & client-side applications.

### JSopX.SharedResources

A traditional central Class Library repository for shared resources such as images, fonts, scripts, and localized strings. This project ensures that all other projects have consistent access to these resources in the initial phases of development you'll follow here, supporting both client-side applications and the server-side.

### JSopX.RCLxAssets

The successor to `JSopX.SharedResources`, incorporating more modern approaches as a Razor Class Library dedicated to managing a heavy developer environment of all static assets like CSS, JavaScript, etc., including creative and other raw source that makes up the shared resources for all projects. It efficiently bundles and serves these assets across projects.

### JSopX.RCLxProper

A production-ready, lightweight Razor Class Library project that includes properly structured Razor components, pages, views, and more! These elements can be shared across different Blazor and Razor-based applications.

### JSopX.RCLxComponents

Another Razor Class Library focused on reusable UI components. These components can be utilized in various Blazor and ASP.NET Core applications to maintain consistency in the UI.
