I will be following a basic set of phases as I develop all JSopX Projects, so we can ensure unique documentation to each project for each phase that outlines at least a basic outline. Conversely, you do not need to use Phases in your approach to development and if you do, I am sure they are different. This is totally fine. In the case of Phases, think more about the importance of each phase, and less about a step-by-step phase lifecycle you need to follow in order.
