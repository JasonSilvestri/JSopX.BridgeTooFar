### Step 1: Create the Parent Basic Markdown Page Sections

1. **Create a `BasicMarkdownPage` markdown file**, save it to `Sectionss`, so we can use it to embed include test markdowns into it.

### Step 2: Create the Child Basic Markdown Page Sections Content Includes

2. **Create a `BasicMarkdownPage` directory**, under `Includes/Content/Sections`, and create as many static markdown sections needed for this sample.

### Step 3: Double Check the Parent Basic Markdown Page Sections for all Includes

1. After adding all `include` blocks in the template, double-check all resources and be sure they exist. 
   
2. If this was done correctly, you should see content added to the live Docs folder.
