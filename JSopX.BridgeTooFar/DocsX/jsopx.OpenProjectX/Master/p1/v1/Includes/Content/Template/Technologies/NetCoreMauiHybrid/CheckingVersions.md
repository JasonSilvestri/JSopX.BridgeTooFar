Check if `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Powershell`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v `8.0.3` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Powershell`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```powershell
      # Using Powershell:
      # Check .NET Core MAUI Hybrid version
   
      dotnet --list-sdks
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Powershell` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have .NET Core MAUI Hybrid installed or you version is **`lower`** than `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.
