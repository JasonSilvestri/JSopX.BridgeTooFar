#### Adding the JSopX™ Bridge Too Far Docs to Other Projects

This is another one of those steps that I did for you, but you never know.

1. **Add Project Reference**:

    - In the solution that requires the common library, right-click on the project in Solution Explorer.
    - Select `Add` > `Reference`.
    - Check the box for `JSopX.BridgeTooFar` and click `OK`.

2. **Use the Common Code**:

    - You can now use the JSopX™ Bridge Too Far Docs from the `JSopX.BridgeTooFar` project in your other projects.
