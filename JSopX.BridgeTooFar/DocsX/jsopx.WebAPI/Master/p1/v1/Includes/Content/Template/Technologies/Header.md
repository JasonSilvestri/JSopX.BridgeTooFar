> [!WARNING]
> The **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`** (_JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection_) Project requires **over a dozen** technologies in order for all projects and features currently available to work as expected. Please try your best to do your do-dillagence in ensuring your technologies stacks are installed and up-to-date.
This section is to help in that area.
