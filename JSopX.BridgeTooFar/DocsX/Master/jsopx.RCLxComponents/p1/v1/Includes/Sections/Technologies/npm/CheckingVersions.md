Check if `npm` v **`10.8.1`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Node`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `npm` v `10.8.1` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Node`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```node
      // Using Node:
      // Check npm version
   
      npm -v
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `npm` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `npm` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `npm` v **`10.8.1`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have npm installed or you version is **`lower`** than `npm` v **`10.8.1`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.
