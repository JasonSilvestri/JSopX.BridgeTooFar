Install `Node` v **`20.14.0`** (_or higher_) if it is not already installed or found on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`Node`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `Node` v `20.14.0` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Node`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

    ```node
        // Install Node.js (via nvm)
        nvm install 20.14.0
        nvm use 20.14.0
    ```
   
   
2. This command should _install_ all necessary `Node` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `Node` Command Line dialog output.
