## Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`npm`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `React` v `18.2.0` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

   ```node
      // Using npm:
      // Install React and React DOM
      npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0
    ```
   
   
2. This command should _install_ all necessary `React` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `React` Command Line dialog output.
