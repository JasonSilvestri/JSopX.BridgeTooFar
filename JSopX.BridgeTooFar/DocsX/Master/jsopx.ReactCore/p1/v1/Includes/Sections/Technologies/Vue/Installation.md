Install `Vue` v **`3.4.21`** (_or higher_) if it is not already installed or found on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`npm`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `Vue` v `3.4.21` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

   ```node
      // Using npm:
      // Install Vue and Vue DOM
      npm install vue@3.4.21
    ```
   
   
2. This command should _install_ all necessary `Vue` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `Vue` Command Line dialog output.
