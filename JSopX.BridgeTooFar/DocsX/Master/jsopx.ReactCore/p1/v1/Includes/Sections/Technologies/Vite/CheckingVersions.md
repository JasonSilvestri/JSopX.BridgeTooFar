## Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Node`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `Vite` v `5.2.8` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```node
      // Using npm:
      // Check Vite version
      npm list vite
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `Vite` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Vite` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `Vite` v **`5.2.8`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have Vite installed or you version is **`lower`** than `Vite` v **`5.2.8`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.
