Check if `Angular CLI` v **`18.0.3`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Angular CLI`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `Angular CLI` v `18.0.3` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```node
      // Using Angular CLI:
      // Check Angular CLI version
   
      ng version
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `Angular CLI` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Angular CLI` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `Angular CLI` v **`18.0.3`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have Angular CLI installed or you version is **`lower`** than `Angular CLI` v **`18.0.3`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.
