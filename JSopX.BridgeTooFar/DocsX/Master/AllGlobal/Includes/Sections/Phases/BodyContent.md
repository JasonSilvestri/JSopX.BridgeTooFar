I will be following a basic set of phases as I develop all JSopX Projects. 

## Phase 1 (Current Phase): Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The sole purpose of Project Development Steps in Phase 1 is to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to similuate a real-world case where stakeholders need some form of proof-of-concept at the soonest possible. 

Please see [Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/Master/JSopX/Phases/Phase-1-Minimum-Viable-Product-MVP.md) for more details.


## Phase 2: Minimum Viable Refactor Product (MVRP)

The purpose of Project Development Steps in Phase 2 is to create a Minimum Viable Reactor Product (MVRP) to similuate a real-world case where the developers should be quickly getting rid of creating more proof-of-concept features. The Minimum Viable Product did its job. Most importantly, it has already outlived its purpose. It is time to start refactoring some of the code and processes created this far, and start thinking about focusing on tying in re-usable Web APIs, assets, and other object oriented programming design patterns and best practices you would expect in a Multi-Plaform, Multi-Stack, Enterprise-Leval Application.

Please see [Phase 2: Minimum Viable Refactor Product (MVRP)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/Master/JSopX/Phases/Phase-2-Minimum-Viable-Refactor-Product-MVRP.md) for more details.


## Phase 3: Advanced User Interface Connectivity and Re-Usability

The purpose of Project Development Steps in Phase 3 is to dig in hard with some of the most advanced aspects of all parts of each project, across the entire project suite. Whatever base assets should be included. Primary Web API should be included. All Project Referenced should be configured. Even the start of Security Protocols should be developed hand-and-hand with areas of the projects that require it.

Please see [Phase 3: Advanced User Interface Connectivity and Re-Usability](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/Master/JSopX/Phases/Phase-3-Advanced-User-Interface-Connectivity-and-Re-Usability.md) for more details.


## Phase 4: Implement Final Security Protocols, Deployment Strategies and More

The purpose of Project Development Steps in Phase 4 is to Implement Final Security Protocols, Deployment Strategies and any other major aspects of the applications you have not yet handled. This isn't a little pat on the back and lets do a good job. If you yet implemented or close to finishing Final Security Protocols you should be worried, along with any other related security design patterns and best practices you may have missed. I cannot stress enough about the importance of taking care of these things before your first release candidate.

Please see [Phase 4: Implement Final Security Protocols, Deployment Strategies and More](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/Master/JSopX/Phases/Phase-4-Implement-Final-Security-Protocols-Deployment-Strategies-and-More.md) for more details.
