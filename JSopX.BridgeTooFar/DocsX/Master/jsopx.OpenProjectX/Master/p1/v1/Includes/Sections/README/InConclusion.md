The `JSopX.OpenProjectX` Project (i.e., _jSilvestri.com BETA v 2025 JSopX™ Open Project EXperience_) is the flagship, all-in-one, FREE, open-source project, includeing the first-of-its-kind, Multi-Platform, Multi-Stack, `JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection` Enterprise-Level Application.

By centralizing project documents with this approach to mark down will be very helpful, especially with referencing the `JSopX.OpenProjectX` Read Me docs across projects.
