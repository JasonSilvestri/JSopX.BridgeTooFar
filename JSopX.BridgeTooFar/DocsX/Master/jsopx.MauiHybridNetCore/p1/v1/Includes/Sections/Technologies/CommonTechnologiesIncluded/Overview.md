# Common Technologies Included:

**Common Technologies Included Require No Further Action**

It is assumed that all JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences _require_ some common technologies that are included in all projects by default. 

The technologies that should be included and supported without any further actions are as follows:

- Bootstrap (v 5.3)
- HTML 5
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 3
- JS (JavaScript)
- TypeScript 5


> [!TIP]
> JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences significantly extend Bootstrap (v 5.3), providing a rich, interactive set of assets that you can also implement in your own projects. See the [JSopX.RCLxProper](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.RCLxProper) project for more details.
