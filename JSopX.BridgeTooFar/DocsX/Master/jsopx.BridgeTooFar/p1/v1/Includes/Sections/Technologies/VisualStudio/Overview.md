Almost all JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences _require_ `Visual Studio` or `Visual Studio Code` v **`17.11.5`** (_or higher_), to develop and run JSopX™ projects. Installing this version ensures compatibility with the latest .NET Core frameworks and modern web development tools. 

In addition, the IDE needs to be up-to-date to also leverage advanced debugging, code analysis, and project management features.

This section is dedicated to helping you ensure you have the correct `Visual Studio` or `Visual Studio Code` setup, by describing how to check versions, perform installations if necessary, check JSopX™ dependencies, get links to official documentation, and more!
