## Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Node`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `React` v `18.2.0` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
   ```node
      // Using npm:
      // Check React version
      npm list react
    ```
   
2. This command checks the `version` of `React` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `React` Command Line dialog output.
   
3. If you have version `React` v **`18.2.0`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have React installed or you version is **`lower`** than `React` v **`18.2.0`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.
