The `JSopX.ClassLibrary` Project (i.e., _jSilvestri.com BETA v 2024 JSopX™ Class Library Open Project EXperience_) is one of several, FREE, open-source projects, included in the first-of-its-kind, Multi-Platform, Multi-Stack, `JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences Collection` Enterprise-Level Application.

By centralizing project properties, filters, and other static, constants, this approach to basic object oriented coding should be one of the first things you do when extending your projects, especially with referencing the `JSopX.ClassLibrary` across projects.
