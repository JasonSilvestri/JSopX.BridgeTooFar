Install `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v **`8.0.3`** (_or higher_) if it is not already installed or found on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`Powershell`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` v `8.0.3` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Powershell`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

    ```powershell
        # Install .NET MAUI workload
        dotnet workload install maui
    ```
   
   
2. This command should _install_ all necessary `.NET Core MAUI Hybrid` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `Powershell` Command Line dialog output.
