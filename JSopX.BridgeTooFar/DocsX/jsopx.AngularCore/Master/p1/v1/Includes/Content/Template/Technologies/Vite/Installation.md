Install `Vite` v **`5.2.8`** (_or higher_) if it is not already installed or found on your device.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`npm`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `Vite` v `5.2.8` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `npm`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

   ```node
      // Using npm:
      // Install Vite and Vite DOM
      npm install -g vite@5.2.8
    ```
   
   
2. This command should _install_ all necessary `Vite` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `Vite` Command Line dialog output.
