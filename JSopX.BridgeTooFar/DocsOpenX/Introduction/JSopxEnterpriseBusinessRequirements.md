## Overview

All the business requirements you will see outlined on this page, comes from our fictional stakeholder. However, make no mistake. The sourced business requirements are very common, very real-world business concerns, that plague so many applications today, which includes some of the best **Start-ups** to **Fortune 500s**.

What boggles my mind, even still, is nowadays, it is **extremely likely** that you or someone you know have receieved a letter from some business, describing how your personal information was on server that was compromised by a data breach, which may or may not have exposed, some or all of your information. 

You can also bring down an airliner... You can invite yourself into someone's house by simply unlocking the digital door lock, and while you are there, swiping-right on their credit card data, by simply waving a smart-phone over the credit cards on the counter, like a magic wand. 

I know it all sounds scary, and it should. You would think it should be a legal requirement to have standards that address the business concerns outlined in these business requirements. **There isn't**. Now, we do have things like HIPPA, which try to reach a level of standards that are manditory before applications can be signed off. You also you have your app stores that do test apps before allowing them into their marketplaces. Still, there is no legally binding standards required by developers to follow before releasing apps into the wild.

The **good news is** that almost all business concerns addressed on this page can be solved by sticking to a development standard of some kind. 

And sure, **nothing** is **ever guaranteed**. Still, **I can't stress** it **enough**. Any other alternative increases your risks of compromising the integratity of one or more of your applications, and across all major facets of your web, mobile & desktop application development platforms.

## 01. Create Enterprise Solution to House All Projects

We need to create an **Enterprise Solution** to house all projects, including new and existing projects in Asp.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, Angular, React, Vue, and more.

- **We create** an enterprise solution ["Flagship" Project](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#1-flagship-projects) to simulate an **all-in-one** enterprise-level solution, which orchestrates a broad range of technologies‚ÄîAsp.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, Angular, React, Vue, and more‚Äîinto a cohesive experience. 

- **We call it** the **Jason Silvestri Open Project EXperiences (JSopX‚Ñ¢)** Collection. We'll also make it a **FREE**, open-source demonstration project, built in Visual Studio, and _code named_, `JSopX.OpenProjectX`.

### **Client Stakeholder Sourced Business Requirement**:

- [We Need to Create a Parent Project to House All Applications](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#2-we-need-to-create-a-parent-project-to-house-all-applications)

### Minimum Disciplines & Standards Required:

- [Security-First Approach](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md#security-first-approach)
- [Documentation & Code Readability](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md#documentation--code-readability)
- [UI/UX Consistency & Creative Design](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md#uiux-consistency--creative-design)
- [Project Lifecycle & Solution Architecture](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md#project-lifecycle--solution-architecture)
- [Object-Oriented Architecture & Scalability](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md#object-oriented-architecture--scalability)

## 02. Manage & Extend a Half Dozen Existing Weather Forecast Applications

We need to **manage**, **extend** and eventually **migrate**, all new and existing projects in Asp.NET Core, Blazor, Angular, React, Vue, and more, to the new [Enterprise Solution](/Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#01-create-enterprise-solution-to-house-all-projects). 

**Right**... _Right_... **Hey**, _listen_... **So**... **About that**... 

So, these, **client-side** and **server-side** applications in Asp.NET Core, Blazor, Angular, and the other ones we have been talking about? Yeah, they don't actually exist in this universe. Yeah, I know, total bummer. Yeah, there was some performance issues... potential for copyright infringement... and of course breaking some NDAs. Stuff like that... Super boring.

- **Cool!** So... we can just **start from scratch**, avoid all that hassle, use **our standards** as we would either way, and all that... **Right?!** Yeah... **No**. _**Sorry**_, **guys**. 
- **If we are going to do this**, we need to **do it right**. Being able to extend existing applications‚Äîis harder, and much more beneficial to you in my opinion. Besides, we need to be able reproduce as much of the original use cases as we can, to ensure we dotted all our "i's" and crossed all our "t's".
- **OK**... _**Well**_, _what is the plan_? Glad you asked. We are totally going create all the client-side and server-side applications we need to simulate the "Existing" Client-side and Server-side App Examples that we need to replicate our use cases, with their very own weather forecast sample data, their own Web API and existing standards. We will even create some security holes, slack on documentation, and all that. It will be fun.


### **Client Stakeholder Sourced Business Requirement**:

- [Over a Half Dozen Existing Weather Forecast Applications Need Upgrades](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#1-over-a-half-dozen-existing-weather-forecast-applications-need-upgrades)

### Minimum Disciplines & Standards Required:

- [Object-Oriented Architecture & Scalability](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md#object-oriented-architecture--scalability)

## 2. Manage and Extend Existing Angular Client Side SPA Project



We need to manage, extend and eventually migrate an existing Angular SPA application into our Enterprise Solution. 

## How We Address Business Concern:

- **We initially create** an Angular project to simulate an ["Existing" Client-side Apps Example](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#5-client-side-existing-apps-examples) Weather Forecast Angular application, with its own Web API and existing standards. 

- As the **project evolves** through each [Lifecycle Phase](../Phases/), we extend the application by creating new user interfaces, implement standardized assets and resources commonly used across projects that comply to the stakeholder's brand new standards we are tasked with creating, etc. 

- **We call it** the **JSopX‚Ñ¢ Angular Core Project**. We'll also make it a **FREE**, open-source demonstration project, built in Visual Studio, and _code named_, `JSopX.AspNetCore`.

- **We put it on GitHub**: [JSopX.AspNetCore](./jsopx.JSopX.AspNetCore)

## **1. Must Prove It's Possible, Because It Is Possible**  

This business requirement isn‚Äôt **optional**‚Äîit's the **#1 business requirement**. Every project must implement **proactive developer support** to aid them at all skill levels.  

The whole reason I made myself responsible for the creation of all aspects of project, from documentation, to every line of code, graphic & feature, using over a dozen epic technologies included in our projects, is to show fellow developers that with the correct business requirements, development standards and strong, honorable, rules of engagements established‚Äîplease believe me when I say you totally have this with proper disciplines!

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## **Postrequisites**  

üîπ Ensure that **all project components** are correctly configured and validated before moving to the next phase.  
üîπ **Conduct peer reviews** to validate documentation, architecture, and implementation.  

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

## **In Conclusion**  

The whole reason I made myself responsible for the creation of all aspects of project, from documentation, to every line of code, graphic & feature, using over a dozen epic technologies included in our projects, is to show fellow developers that with the correct [business requirements](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md), [development standards](../Introduction/JSopxDevelopmentStandards.md) and strong, honorable, [rules of engagements](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md) established‚Äîit is totally possible! 

**Full Disclsure**‚Äî I did spend the past 20 years perfecting my skills in full stack development to be able to do what we are doing right this minute. And... I spent the last 8 months developing everything you see here... And, well, I spent over $100K in time and materials. "Shhh...Shhhh. Shhhh. Alright, alright.. Calm, down.. Calm, down..." Please don't get discouraged. 

Everything in all projects are totally free, open-source, and you can use however you want. Besides, we are going to produce results in 48 hours. 

It's going to begin with some basic business requirements. 

- **JSopX‚Ñ¢ development disciplines ensure:**  
- **Security & Data Protection**  
- **Performance Optimization**  
- **Architecture, Scalability & Maintainability**  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**  
- **Multi-Platform Compatibility**  
- **Code Reusability & Documentation**  
- **Centralized API & Data Flow**  
- **UI/UX Creative Design Standards**  
- **Open-Source and/or Free Accessibility**  
- **Face Your Standards' Guilt** 
> **"Discipline in coding creates discipline in application success."**
