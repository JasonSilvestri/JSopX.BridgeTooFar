## Overview

All the business requirements you will see outlined on this page, comes from our fictional stakeholder. However, make no mistake. The sourced business requirements are very common, very real-world business concerns, that plague so many applications today, which includes some of the best **Start-ups** to **Fortune 500s**.

What boggles my mind, even still, is nowadays, it is **extremely likely** that you or someone you know have receieved a letter from some business, describing how your personal information was on server that was compromised by a data breach, which may or may not have exposed, some or all of your information. 

You can also bring down an airliner... You can invite yourself into someone's house by simply unlocking the digital door lock, and while you are there, swiping-right on their credit card data, by simply waving a smart-phone over the credit cards on the counter, like a magic wand. 

I know it all sounds scary, and it should. You would think it should be a legal requirement to have standards that address the business concerns outlined in these business requirements. **There isn't**. Now, we do have things like HIPPA, which try to reach a level of standards that are manditory before applications can be signed off. You also you have your app stores that do test apps before allowing them into their marketplaces. Still, there is no legally binding standards required by developers to follow before releasing apps into the wild.

The **good news is** that almost all business concerns addressed on this page can be solved by sticking to a development standard of some kind. 

And sure, **nothing** is **ever guaranteed**. Still, **I can't stress** it **enough**. Any other alternative increases your risks of compromising the integratity of one or more of your applications, and across all major facets of your web, mobile & desktop application development platforms.

## Tying Stakeholder Sourced Business Requirements to the Team's Development Standards

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> For brevity, our leadership, the sales team, and the client stakeholder has **already approved** the **final business requirements** listed _below_. In addition, the order and amount may differ from the sourced business requirements (_this is common_).
>

---

Now, to some of you **Sr. Developers** and **Solution Architects**, you will look at those business requirements, look at the budget, time it will take, and think, "_We have been up against worse. Let's Do This!_" Not only would **you not be wrong**, but I personally find that to be an admirable approach to such a complicated sitution, and commend you for it. 

To me, however, I see something else too. I see a complete recipe for disaster, no matter how good we are, without us being allowed to follow our standards aggressively. I also see a sinking ship that has little hope for survival without us. **But I do still see hope**. One thing I read between the lines is that the stakeholders aware of it, and they are trying to take steps in righting all the wrongs. Whether it is a desperate attempt at salvaging what still can be or not, it shows that change is possible, and that's enough.

### **Perform Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation**

The **good news** with _this_ **business requirement** is that **we just completed it**. Before we engaged with the existing projects, I was able to head into the client stakeholder's main office half-way across the country, and spent about a week _on-site_, conducting a thorough evaluation to understand its current state and history.

**I was able to**:

- **Interpret business requirements** into carefully crafted action items, aligning them with working standards as often as possible.  
- **Assess the project's architecture and codebase** to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
- **Engage with stakeholders** to comprehend their expectations and any previous challenges faced.
- **Determine the feasibility of integrating new features** without compromising existing functionalities.
- **Document findings and recommendations** to inform decision-making and ensure alignment with project goals (_what you are viewing right now_).

The **bad news** with _this_ **business requirement** is that we have a much bigger picture now on what is really going on over there. Yes, we are prepared for these kind of things now, but still need to tread very carefully.

### **We Must Enforce Documentation & Code Readability**

There really was no documentation. I mean, there never is, but like, really... 

**They had zero documentation**. 

Code that isn’t documented **doesn’t exist**. Every project must include **clear, structured documentation** for their developers, our developers and stakeholders. There is no we'll-start-a-week-after-we-start-development. We need to be writing documentation in paralell with any code we write immediately with this one.

- **Client-side**: Document **functions** in JavaScript/TypeScript using JSDoc or inline comments.  
- **Server-side**: Use `<summary></summary>` XML documentation for API controllers, services, and models.  
- **Every project must contain a `README.md`**, explaining setup, usage, and key features.  

#### **Client Stakeholder Sourced Business Requirement**:

- [No Documentation](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#8-no-documentation)

### **We Must Ensure Security-First Approach: Addressing Security Holes**  

The stakeholder has almost no common security measures put in place. More importantly, something I couldn't get to quick enough, here, is with respects to their quote on quote, "_Security Holes_", described in the corrisponding Sourced Business Requirement. 

When any company is experiencing brute force attacks, this means they actively have bad actors attempting to compromise their systems and firewalls. I was able to help IT put out some immediate fires, but my primary objective was to assess. Besides, it all goes without saying...

Security isn’t **optional**—it's a **requirement**. Every project must implement **proactive security measures** at all levels. 

- **Validate and sanitize inputs** using TypeScript, Regular Expressions, and strict data-binding practices.  
- **Implement model validation** in **ASP.NET Core, Blazor, and MAUI Hybrid** to enforce data integrity.  
- **Enforce CORS policies** to regulate cross-domain API access.  
- **Utilize HTTPS encryption**, **JWT authentication**, and **OAuth** for secure transactions.

### **We Need to Create Centralized API & Data Flow**

This may have been missed by most of you looking on, because the source buisness requirements speak very little to the apps needing to start using the new corporate Web API. It was tucked away, in a line item, referencing the need to start to using corporate logos and images. Obviously, such a requirement is no surprise to us, because we understand that a centralized API is a natural course to go based on our collective objectives. 

In fact, we already know that a **single, unified API strategy** is critical for **data consistency, maintainability, and scalability**. 

**Isn't that right... `Team Us`? That's right. Just making sure you are still paying attention.**

- Consolidate backend services into **one centralized Web API**.  
- Ensure **proper property binding** in Razor Pages and Blazor apps for seamless data processing.  
- Implement **client-side and server-side model validation** to prevent incorrect API calls.

### **We Need to Ensure UI/UX Consistency & Creative Design Standards**

They were not kidding about how almost no one project looks like the other. Facelifts? Those apps have faces only a mother can love. 

A visually inconsistent application creates confusion. **Every JSopX™ project must maintain standardized UI/UX elements.**  

For the record, I know these areas of expertise are like kryptonite to many, many developers. I also have to admit that little surprises me like this does. This sorta needs to become a thing of the past. More developers need to at least get more familar with HTML & CSS, especially if you are responsible for applying these types of standards to projects for the first time. 

I have more **good news**. I got your back this time. 

I went to extreme lengths in not only creating a standard using a CSS framework, but I also extended it to ensure all projects have their own epic look and feel that conform to their brand image. For now, lets not get ahead of ourselves. 

Just know that, now, and in future projects, we'll want to start mastering these areas of expertise. If you have an UX and/or Creative Design team at your disposal, become their best friends, and get them involved with this materal (_this is a common alernative_) to help:

- Use **CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)** to create reusable design standards.  
- Extend branding into **Razor Class Libraries (RCLs)** for **scalable, modular UI components**.  
- Ensure **all UI components are responsive** and optimized for **desktop, tablet, and mobile experiences**.

### **We Need to Ensure Multi-Platform Compatibility & Responsive Design**

Some more **good news**. JSopX™ projects already support **seamlessly across multiple platforms**.  

- **Web Browsers**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, etc (_Response Design_).  
- **Desktop Apps**: Windows, Linux, macOS.  
- **Mobile**: iOS, Android, Samsung (via **.NET MAUI Hybrid** or **PWA**).  
- Leverage **Razor Components** to create shared UI experiences across platforms.  

One thing many companies get confused about is the difference between **Multi-Platform Compatibility** and **Responsive Design**. 

**Multi-Platform Compatibility** covers the entire scope of various hardware and software iterations of the applications, whereas, **Responsive Design** deals solely with ensuring web applications meet view standards across devices that support web browsers.

**Source control is non-negotiable**—it's the backbone of collaborative development and code integrity.

- **Utilize distributed version control systems** like **Git**, **SVN**, or **Mercurial** to manage code changes effectively.
- **Implement branching strategies** (e.g., Git Flow) to facilitate parallel development and streamline feature integration.
- **Integrate source control with CI/CD pipelines** to automate testing and deployment processes.
- **Maintain comprehensive commit histories** to ensure traceability and accountability across the development lifecycle.

A well-defined project lifecycle ensures **consistency, scalability, and maintainability** across enterprise applications.

- **Adopt standard project structures** using **Visual Studio**:
  - **`.csproj`** for server-side applications.
  - **`.esproj`** for client-side applications.
  - **`.sln`** files to manage and organize multiple related projects.
- **Separate concerns** by modularizing codebases into distinct projects for APIs, services, and UI components.
- **Implement lifecycle management practices** such as **planning**, **execution**, **monitoring**, and **closure** to align with business objectives and timelines.
- **Leverage tools** like **Azure DevOps** or **Jira** to track progress, manage tasks, and facilitate team collaboration throughout the project lifecycle.

Enterprise applications must be **modular, reusable, and scalable** using Object-Oriented Programming (**OOP**).  

- Maximize **code reusability** using **Class Libraries, Razor Class Libraries, and Web APIs**.  
- Adhere to **Clean Architecture** principles to maintain **separation of concerns**.  
- Follow **Visual Studio solution structures** that support **long-term scalability**.

### We Must Create Enterprise Solution to House All Projects

We need to create an **Enterprise Solution** to house all projects, including new and existing projects in Asp.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, Angular, React, Vue, and more.

- **We create** an enterprise solution ["Flagship" Project](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#1-flagship-projects) to simulate an **all-in-one** enterprise-level solution, which orchestrates a broad range of technologies—Asp.NET Core, Blazor, .NET MAUI, Angular, React, Vue, and more—into a cohesive experience. 

- **We call it** the **Jason Silvestri Open Project EXperiences (JSopX™)** Collection. We'll also make it a **FREE**, open-source demonstration project, built in Visual Studio, and _code named_, `JSopX.OpenProjectX`.

### We Must Manage & Extend a Half Dozen Existing Weather Forecast Applications

We need to **manage**, **extend** and eventually **migrate**, all new and existing projects in Asp.NET Core, Blazor, Angular, React, Vue, and more, to the new [Enterprise Solution](/Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#01-create-enterprise-solution-to-house-all-projects). 

**Right**... _Right_... **Hey**, _listen_... **So**... **About that**... 

So, these, **client-side** and **server-side** applications in Asp.NET Core, Blazor, Angular, and the other ones we have been talking about? Yeah, they don't actually exist in this universe. Yeah, I know, total bummer. Yeah, there was some performance issues... potential for copyright infringement... and of course breaking some NDAs. Stuff like that... Super boring.

- **Cool!** So... we can just **start from scratch**, avoid all that hassle, use **our standards** as we would either way, and all that... **Right?!** Yeah... **No**. _**Sorry**_, **guys**. 
- **If we are going to do this**, we need to **do it right**. Being able to extend existing applications—is harder, and much more beneficial to you in my opinion. Besides, we need to be able reproduce as much of the original use cases as we can, to ensure we dotted all our "i's" and crossed all our "t's".
- **OK**... _**Well**_, _what is the plan_? Glad you asked. We are totally going create all the client-side and server-side applications we need to simulate the "Existing" Client-side and Server-side App Examples that we need to replicate our use cases, with their very own weather forecast sample data, their own Web API and existing standards. We will even create some security holes, slack on documentation, and all that. It will be fun.
