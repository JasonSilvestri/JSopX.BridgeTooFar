## Overview

All the business requirements you will see outlined on this page, comes from our fictional stakeholder. However, make no mistake. The sourced business requirements are very common, very real-world business concerns, that plague so many applications today, which includes some of the best **Start-ups** to **Fortune 500s**.

What boggles my mind, even still, is nowadays, it is **extremely likely** that you or someone you know have receieved a letter from some business, describing how your personal information was on server that was compromised by a data breach, which may or may not have exposed, some or all of your information. 

You can also bring down an airliner... You can invite yourself into someone's house by simply unlocking the digital door lock, and while you are there, swiping-right on their credit card data, by simply waving a smart-phone over the credit cards on the counter, like a magic wand. 

I know it all sounds scary, and it should. You would think it should be a legal requirement to have standards that address the business concerns outlined in these business requirements. **There isn't**. Now, we do have things like HIPPA, which try to reach a level of standards that are manditory before applications can be signed off. You also you have your app stores that do test apps before allowing them into their marketplaces. Still, there is no legally binding standards required by developers to follow before releasing apps into the wild.

The **good news is** that almost all business concerns addressed on this page can be solved by sticking to a development standard of some kind. 

And sure, **nothing** is **ever guaranteed**. Still, **I can't stress** it **enough**. Any other alternative increases your risks of compromising the integratity of one or more of your applications, and across all major facets of your web, mobile & desktop application development platforms.

## Sourcing Client Stakeholder to Create JSopX™ Business Requirements

> [!TIP]
>
> This is **not a typical scenario** with a mainstream client, where we would need to manufacture business requirements from one or more of a stakeholder's source business requirements, unless of course, you or the team were left out of the proposal creation process, which does happen. Then again, anything is possible. I once received a year's worth of business requirements on a napkin so.... Yeah...
>

What is **a typical scenario** you'd see if working along-side me is how I would interpret each sourced business requirement from such a situation, and convert them into more sensible action items for the team, while tying the teams current Development Standards to the finalized Business Requirements, by literally using a one of our Development Standards, by performing a Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation. 

Moreover, largely why I pulled this client stakeholder business case from the dark achieves above all others, is because of how uniquely bat-shit crazy it truly was before we even put our hands on it.  The potential for disaster were magnitutes larger than the sales team could or would ever want to know, and that is if everything we do is done right.

The end goal of this section is to create finalized business requirements:

✅ **1. Quickly Previewing Stakeholder High-Level Details** 

✅ **2. Perform Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation**

✅ **3. Create Final Business Requirements**

### **1. Quickly Preview Stakeholder High-Level Details**  

We don't have much to work with, which should not be a big surprise with these guys. 

✅ **Stakeholder Name**: 

We Hate Developers  

✅ **Stakeholder Mission Statement**: 

Our goal is to make developers misrable. Why? Because our hand-crafted team is made up of developers, of all skill levels, that spent the past few years, with a passion for developing cutting edge apps, using no standards, and without ever listening to `Team Us`. Now, our apps are barely maintanable, and we are screwed.

✅ **Estimated Time to Completion**: 6-9 Months 

✅ **Estimated Budget**: $250K-$300K  

✅ **Development Team**: Made up of Jr. & Sr. Developers  

✅ **Sales Team Notes**: 

We already guarateed the client we can do the work.

### 2. Perform Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation

We need to carfully review client stakeholder sourced business requirements, by performing Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation.

It is not uncommon for a stakeholder to use their own catch phrases and buzz words when describing their current business requiremnents on a project. Other times they do their best to describe certain needs that are not easily described. then, there are times, unfortunately, when many of a stakeholder's developers, creative designers and UX team members, come and go, and if they are not following some form of standards along the way, producing standards, documentation, can put a client stakeholder in a dyer situation that they never expected. 

In other words, it may not be particularly obvious what a client stakeholder is trying to describe in their version of what they consider business requirements.

### **2.1: Over a Half Dozen Existing Weather Forecast Applications Need Upgrades**  

- OK, so, we have **over a half dozen** existing **client-side** and **server-side** weather forecast applications.
- We use an array of different mainstream technologies, ranging from [ASP.NET Core](../OpenProjects/jsopx.AspNetCore/README.md) to [Angular](../OpenProjects/jsopx.AngularCore/README.md), [Vue](../OpenProjects/jsopx.VueCore/README.md), [React](../OpenProjects/jsopx.ReactCore/README.md), [Blazor](../OpenProjects/jsopx.BlazorServerCore/README.md), etc. Oh, and they use [Node](./Technologies/Node.md) and [npm](./Technologies/npm.md) some times.
- All Applications require upgrades!

### **2.2: We Need to Create a Parent Project to House All Applications**  

We also need to create an enterprise application that:
  - Not only houses all the projects, but the origin projects still need to run stand alone and/or collectively within the enterprise solution, because we only have one developer that manages all projects
  - All other developers have skill levels from novice-to-expert. Some developers may only manage one or more projects, where others will learn to manage all projects.

### **2.3: Security Holes**  

- There are security holes in just about every application. Some of the developers report a nicer picture, but our IT Admin says we are fighting off brute force attacks once or twice a week on our hosting server.

### **2.4: All Applications Do Their Own Thing**  

- All the applications perform similar functionality, but they all have their own, independent assets, web apis, and even their own look and feel. 

#### **JSopX™ Business Requirement**:

- [UI/UX Consistency & Creative Design](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#uiux-consistency--creative-design)

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### **2.5: All Applications Need A Facelift**  


- Almost no one project looks like the other. They need face-lifts. 
- Some of the applications don't even have official project names. They just say, "_Weather Forecast._"
- We need to create some consistent look and feel that reflects our brand. 
- Oh, yeah, and all projects need to leverage images and logos from corporate, and all need to begin using our new corporate web api. However, they need to be able to access their own web apis as well for a period of time, until we know for sure all data is the latest.

### **2.6: Other Applications We Use To Share**  

- The team did create what they call a Shared Resource Library that some of the applications use that have common properties they use. They said they stopped maintaining it a few months ago, but that we need to make more of them.

- [Security-First Approach: Addressing Security Holes](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#security-first-approach-addressing-security-holes)

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### **2.7: All Applications Have Communities**  

- Most of the applications have built communities aroud their versions of how they share weather forecasting. So we can't just throw one or more apps away and start anew. I wish we could. My boss said what makes us unique are the different technolgies we use. They all look like screens to me.

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### **2.8: We Need to Extend All Applications with Similar Features**  

- Once we figure out all the kinks with how we are going to do all this, we'll need to be able to extend one or all the applications, at any time, to include features like login and registration, Dashboards for latest weather updates, etc.

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### **2.9: Unrealiable Team Dynamic**  

- Some of the apps have developers of whom came and left. Some still have developers who are very passionate about what they built. One developer is even rumored to have sabotaged the last two interviews corporate scheduled to try and retain some more help, because they just didn't trust someone else new with everything going on. We are not sure who will be available to help given everyone's workload, which right now is a lot of bandaid work.

### **2.10: No Documentation**  

- There is no documentation for any of the applications. Sorry. 
- I asked a Sr. Developer the other day why that was and he said something like, "_if our developers are as good as they say they are, they should be able to walk through the code no problem._" I have no idea what that means. 
- All I know is the boss said we need to fix that, so I can only assume that means someone needs to create documentation. 

#### **JSopX™ Business Requirement**:

- [Documentation & Code Readability](../Introduction/JSopxEnterpriseBusinessRequirements.md#documentation--code-readability)

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### **2.11: The Applications Need To Be User Friendly on Desktop and Phones**  

- Some of the applications can be viewed on our phones alright, others can't be used on phones. Most seem to look OK on our laptops and desktops, but features sometimes don't look right or even work. My boss said we need the applications to have responsive designs. so they are multi-platform compatible.
