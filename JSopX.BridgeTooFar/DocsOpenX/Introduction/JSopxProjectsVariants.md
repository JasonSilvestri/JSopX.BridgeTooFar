## **Overview**  

The custom `JSopX™ Project Variants` concept is an attempt of tackling the complexity of exploring one, more and/or all integrated projects that make up the JSopX™ enterprise solution, regardless of a developer's skillset or level.

You'll notice a section at the top of most primary project pages—typically the very first page—showing an alert section outlining the Project Variant you are currently reviewing.

## Using JSopX™ Project Variants to Address Several Business Concerns

The business concerns we are trying to address using JSopX™ Project Variants relate to business requirements set forth by the client stakeholder.

Primarily, whether you realize it or not yet, the JSopX™ enterprise solution is made up of over a dozen different projects. To me and developers like me, handling that many projects is what I do all day long. To other developers, especially Jr. Developers, the idea of that alone is daunting. Even then, what one developer may seem as easy, another developer of the same exact experience and skillsets could see it in a totally different way.

The bare minimum requirements that must be available to Developers are as follows:

---

### 1. **All-In-One JSopX™ Enterprise Solution**:

Developers must be able to `explore`, `install` and `run` all available projects under one, [Flagship Project](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#1-flagship-projects). This is the recommended approach, because the end goal should be to ensure you have general working knowledge under one enterprise solution, because JSopX™ is in fact an enterprise solution.

### 2. **Independent Project Exploration**: 

Developers must be able to `explore`, `install` and `run` the very same projects, independent from one another. This includes, for example, projects that take advantage of the latest Web API or RCLs in the enterprise solution setting, will still need to be able to replicate the end user experience, even if one or two project are of interest. 

Manhandling the projects these ways are less than ideal. There is room to argue that the developer in this case is already starting to fall into bad habbits, by not sticking to the established marching orders. I hear you. However, there are finite instances where this need is applicable. 

For example, the team may be fully aware of all [Client-Side “Existing” Apps Example](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#5-client-side-existing-apps-examples) and [Server-Side “Existing” Apps Example](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#4-server-side-existing-apps-examples) projects inside and out (_as you should_). What if one of the new guys just needs documentation or needs to brush up on the latest creative standards? They'll need access to the [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects). Whether every project is in source control or not, someone is going to be playing revert games at some point. I hate to say it, but leaving the option available has its benefits.

### 3. **Unique Opportunity to Explore Projects by Phase**:  

A unique, and beneficial approach to the development of all the projects, was done by [JSopX™ Lifecycle Phases](../Phases/). Almost equal in usefulness, to be able to explore previous versions of Projects at the [JSopX™ Lifecycle Phase](../Phases/) level, gives a broad brush-stroke view of how an entire phase of action tems were developed (as opposed to any tasks). This approach can also better help existing and new developers better predict what needs to be done, project-by-project, with features of the same nature, and/or to better understand how each technology handles the same tasks.

### 4. **Then We Have The Heroes**: 

Some Developers must tear things apart and/or re-create features step-by-step, from Scratch, in order for certain things to sink in more effectively.

### 5. **It May Be Just You On this Beast**: 

It is quite possible you are the only one on your team hammering this beast. I know for sure that the client stakeholder only had one developer managing all their projects from his laptop. No sources control. No way for others to do things without the gatekeeper. Whether you are that guy or not, you need to be able to have access to the origin projects, while using some form of source control, and all projects need to be fed by those same origin projects, regardless of it being done, project-by-project or by the all in one Enterprise Solution.

###  6. **All Options Must Available for Jr. & Sr. Developers**: 

If this suite is to really be for all developer skill levels, they must have all options in this area if they are even going to start.

With all that said, you can think of `Project Variants` as a way to explore all these options, looking at the project content, regardless of whether you are installing projects or just exploring them.

## JSopX™ Project Variant Options

The current variant options are as follows:

### **Option 1: “Using Latest” Project Variant**:

The default for every project, the `Using Latest` **Project Variant** is largely what it sounds like. You are currently viewing content that represents the latest version of the **[`JSopX.AngularCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxangularcore)** Project. If you choose to _continue_ **exploring** or **installing**, you are doing so using the project's `Using Latest` Project Variant, in anticipation that you are after a version of the project that can still be independently evaluated, but with all project features already created for you.

### **Option 2: “By-Phase” Project Variant**: 

The `By-Phase` **`Project Variant`** allows you to browse previous versions of the **[`JSopX.AngularCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxangularcore)** Project, based on the [Lifecycle Phase](../Phases/). If you choose to _continue_ **exploring**, you are doing so using the current project, on a `By-Phase` Project Variant basis. By exploring project resources in this way, you do get a rather unique way of looking at broad-stroke layers of work done across projects.

### **Option 3: “Start from Scratch” Project Variant**: 

The `Start from Scratch` **Project Variant** allows you to re-create your own custom iteration of a project from scratch, step-by-step. If you choose to _continue_ **creating** features, step-by-step, you are doing so using the current project, `Start from Scratch` Project Variant until the end, where you subsequentialy move onto the next `Start from Scratch` Project Variant.

### **JSopX™ Project Variant `Getting Started` Workflow:**

> [!NOTE]
>
> This **approach is experimental**—how content is configured and the options currently available. The approach may change. Me personally? I feel it is still a bit busy, page-per-page.

Projects like [`JSopX.AspNetCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxaspnetcore) and [`JSopX.BlazorServerCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxblazorservercore) simulate existing server-side applications brought into the enterprise fold. They integrate with shared resources and APIs, demonstrating how older or isolated solutions can align with modern standards.

### **5. Client-Side “Existing” Apps Examples:**  
Whether [`JSopX.AngularCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxangularcore), [`JSopX.ReactCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxreactcore), or [`JSopX.VueCore`](../OpenProjects/ReadMe.md#jsopxvuecore), these SPAs show how diverse client-side stacks can coexist in one environment, all benefiting from centralized logic and consistent asset management.
