## **Overview**  

In a lot of cases, Business Requirements are simply presented and we all take the steps to complete. Conversely, I wanted to share a unique business case, that can give you a rare look into why using a series of disciplines, design patterns, best practices and standards, specifically designed for sustainable enterprise product development is not only crucial, but how when done correctly, can help you tackle some of the most daunting Business Requirements.

### **1. Client Stakeholder Sourced Business Requirements**:  

Before engaging with an existing project, conduct a thorough evaluation to understand its current state and history.

- **Quickly Previewing Stakeholder High-Level Details** to get a general sense of the scope of the client stakeholder.  
- **Perform Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation** by carefully reviewing the sourced Client Stakeholder Business Requirements.

See, [Client Stakeholder Sourced Business Requirements](../Introduction/JSopxClientStakeholderBusinessRequirements.md) for more details.

### **2. Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation**:  

Before engaging with an existing project, we need to carfully review client stakeholder sourced business requirements, and performing Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation.

- **Interpret business requirements** into carefully crafted action items, aligning them with working standards as often as possible.  
- **Assess the project's architecture and codebase** to identify potential issues and areas for improvement.
- **Engage with stakeholders** to comprehend their expectations and any previous challenges faced.
- **Determine the feasibility of integrating new features** without compromising existing functionalities.
- **Document findings and recommendations** to inform decision-making and ensure alignment with project goals.

See, [Skeptical Analysis & Pre-Existing Project Evaluation](../Introduction/JSopxSkepticalAnalysisBusinessRequirements.md) for more details.
