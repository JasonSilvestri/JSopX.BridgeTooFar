## **Custom JSopX™ Alerts**  

Beyond the general types, certain specialized alerts frequently appear throughout JSopX™ documentation. These alerts provide contextual cues about the document’s state, development phase, or complexity:

---

### **This is a Draft**:  

The `This is a Draft` alert is often placed near the top of new or in-progress documents. These alerts caution readers that the content is not yet finalized.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **This is a DRAFT:**
>
> The following content is a preliminary version and may contain placeholders or inaccuracies. Please do not treat it as final. This draft is subject to change or removal as the document matures.

### **Current Phase:**  

The `Current Phase` alerts indicate the project’s developmental stage, helping readers understand the context in which they’re reviewing the material. These are typically found near the top of documents, following any draft alerts.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
>
> This document is currently aligned with **Phase 1** of development. As a result, the content may not be fully accurate or ready for production use. Treat it as reference material while the project evolves.

### **Rabbit Hole**  

The `Rabbit Hole` alerts serve as a playful yet serious warning that the upcoming content may lead into complex, time-consuming, or particularly tricky territory. They’re a gentle reminder to proceed with caution—or to reconsider whether exploring this path is truly necessary.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Rabbit Hole Detected: Custom Project Refernces**

While these alerts introduce a bit of humor, they also serve a practical purpose—helping readers recognize when they’re stepping outside of straightforward, well-documented territory.
