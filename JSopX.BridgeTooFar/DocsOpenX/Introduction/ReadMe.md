## **Overview**

In a world where client-side frameworks like Angular, React, and Vue dominate, my **Jason Silvestri Open Project EXperiences (JSopX™) Collection** are your essential guide to bridging the critical gap between front-end dynamism and back-end security. 

By showcasing seamless integration with ASP.NET Core, these projects not only highlight best practices but also foster a collaborative environment for developers to elevate their skills and secure their applications.

### Why **Asp.NET Core**? 

**I'm glad you asked**. Balancing client-side and server-side operations has become increasingly challenging in today's web, desktop computer application, and native mobile device development landscape. 

With the rise of powerful client-side JavaScript frameworks, many developers have gravitated towards these technologies, often at the expense of robust server-side security and best practices. This trend has led to significant concerns and vulnerabilities that need to be addressed to build secure, scalable, and maintainable applications.

JSopX™ provides a unified framework of guidelines, organizational structures, and best practices designed to streamline project setup, enhance collaboration, and improve maintainability. By adopting these conventions, developers can more easily navigate diverse technologies, ensure consistent quality standards, and quickly understand the logic and layout of each component within the broader ecosystem. As you progress through the documentation, you’ll gain insights into how to structure projects, leverage existing patterns, and adapt them for both current and future needs.
