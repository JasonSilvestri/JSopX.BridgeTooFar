# JSopXâ„¢ Rules of Engagement

**When Solid Business Requirements, Disciplines & Standards for Sustainable Enterprise Product Development Don't Apply**

---

**JSopXâ„¢ Rules of Engagement** may not get as much attention as the rest of the project design patterns and best practices. However, they are what keeps me alive in the zombie apocalypse. By exploring the [Overview](#overview), youâ€™ll start to understand that sometimes, it takes more than skills, solid business requirements, disciplines & standards for sustainable enterprise product development. Sometimes, it takes **just being human**.

## **Overview**  

**JSopXâ„¢ Rules of Engagement** may not get as much attention as the rest of the project design patterns and best practices. However, they are what keeps me alive in the zombie apocalypse.

Sometimes, it takes more than skills, solid business requirements, or disciplines & standards for sustainable enterprise product development. Sometimes, **it takes being human**.

## Compromise and Collaboration

The journey towards building secure and effective applications starts with compromise and collaboration. Developers often choose technologies based on their comfort zones, sometimes ignoring best practices and security implications. It's time to bridge this gap by working together and compromising where necessary.

Outside of all the negative business politics, collaborating with team members, in your team, or a client stakeholders' team, is almost always one of the most crucial survival strategies you can have in a zombie apocolype. Nevermind, the hell that awaits a developer around every corner. 

Even in some extreme cases, like, when a bad actor once known for getting a complete thrill by sabotaging your team whenever possible, can become your team's greatest ally if under the right circumstances. Eventually, its going to be you and them against a zombie horde. What then? What if the whole reason for his bad acts against your kind was because he didn't appreciate you not inviting him to the Wednesday afternoon meeting.

## Appreciate One's Fear of Change

There are a million and one reasons why a person might be doing something the rest of the team finds anoying, lazy and or self preserving, as opposed to doing what is best for the business, and so-on, and so-forth. Can you really blame anyone entirely for thinking in their own self interests anyway, when our entire sociality is run on capitalism? Some of our most primal tendencies come from this place, built into our DNA.

What if a person is just mad because you didn't ask them first before updating code in their prized app? What if part of your role soon will be to decomission said app? What, then? What if, they already know? What if it was never them to begin with, and he has actually always hated the app, and it was really the lady down the hall, all along, mad at him (and now, you), because you are about to take the only app away that allows her to automatically submit parts of her workflow right from home? 

So, when it is sometimes, I feel one of the best things you can do is extend an olive branch... You see one or more people in distress, in and around your team? Ask what is wrong, and can you help them understand something better they may or may not fully understand about why you are there, and what is it that you are doing? You would be surprised how many people had a problem with you or your team, when all they thought was they or their app is on the chopping block, when neither was ever remotely the case. 

"_We are still talking about building enterprise applications, right?_" **You damn, right, we are!**

## Taking Responsibility

While itâ€™s easy to blame companies or individual developers for security breaches, the responsibility lies with all of us. Whether itâ€™s the company allowing vulnerabilities to occur or developers choosing the easy path, we must all take responsibility and act on it. Producing secure applications is a collective effort, and even then, we must acknowledge that there are always hackers better than us. However, this doesnâ€™t mean we leave my applications vulnerable.

## Encouraging Peer Review

To ensure we do the right thing, we must engage in regular peer reviews. By sharing these projects for free, we encourage others to review my work, hold us accountable, and question my approaches. This collaborative spirit will help us improve my practices and build more secure applications.
