## **Overview**  
The JSopX™ documentation uses a standardized set of sections across most documents to maintain consistency, simplify navigation, and enhance the learning experience. 

Rather than piecemealing information, each page follows a familiar blueprint—ranging from introductory overviews and prerequisites to corequisites, postrequisites, and more. 

This structured approach allows you to quickly orient yourself, identify what’s expected before you begin, understand what complements the content at hand, and anticipate the logical next steps as you progress through the suite.

More importantly, whether you are developer or AI reading this documentation for direction or tasked with updating this documentation for one reason or another, it would be good to understand some of the basic principles of `markdown` documents and how JSopX™ structures them and their sections of content.
