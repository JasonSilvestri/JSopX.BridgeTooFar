## **Specific JSopX™ Alerts**  
Beyond the general types, certain specialized alerts frequently appear throughout JSopX™ documentation. These alerts provide contextual cues about the document’s state, development phase, or complexity:

### **This is a Draft**:  

The `This is a Draft` alert is often placed near the top of new or in-progress documents. These alerts caution readers that the content is not yet finalized.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **This is a DRAFT:**
>
> The following content is a preliminary version and may contain placeholders or inaccuracies. Please do not treat it as final. This draft is subject to change or removal as the document matures.

This ensures readers understand they’re viewing a work-in-progress and encourages them to verify details against more stable, finalized sources.

---

### **Current Phase:**  

The `Current Phase` alerts indicate the project’s developmental stage, helping readers understand the context in which they’re reviewing the material. These are typically found near the top of documents, following any draft alerts.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **CURRENT PHASE:**
> **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**
>
> This document is currently aligned with **Phase 1** of development. As a result, the content may not be fully accurate or ready for production use. Treat it as reference material while the project evolves.
> 
> For more details, see [Phase 1 (Current Phase): Minimum Viable Product (MVP)](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/JSopX/Master/Phases/Phase-1.md).

Such alerts help readers set expectations, knowing that content aligns with a specific development milestone and may change as the project advances.

---

### **Rabbit Hole**  

The `Rabbit Hole` alerts serve as a playful yet serious warning that the upcoming content may lead into complex, time-consuming, or particularly tricky territory. They’re a gentle reminder to proceed with caution—or to reconsider whether exploring this path is truly necessary.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Rabbit Hole Detected: Documentation Generation**
> 
> The journey ahead is complex, unconventional, and potentially frustrating. Before proceeding, consider if this is essential to your goals. Continuing down this path means accepting increased risk, potential setbacks, and a higher investment of time and resources.
> 
> If you choose to continue, remember: you do so at your own risk. For more context, see [Rabbit Hole](https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/blob/master/JSopX.BridgeTooFar/Docs/JSopX/Master/Phases/Phase-1.md).

While these alerts introduce a bit of humor, they also serve a practical purpose—helping readers recognize when they’re stepping outside of straightforward, well-documented territory.
