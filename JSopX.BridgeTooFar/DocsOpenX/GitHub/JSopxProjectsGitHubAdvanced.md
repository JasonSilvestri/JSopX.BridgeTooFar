## **Step 1: Organize Projects with Solution and Project Folders**

Proper organization prevents issues with references and dependencies:

1. Create a **solution folder** and a **project folder** for each project:
   ```
   ├── JSopX.ClassLibrary/
   │   ├── JSopX.ClassLibrary.sln
   │   ├── JSopX.ClassLibrary/
   │   │   └── JSopX.ClassLibrary.csproj
   ```

2. Store each solution (`.sln`) in the root of its corresponding project folder. This ensures all references resolve consistently.

In order to meet all business requirements with respect to how a lone admin could manage the JSopX Enterprise solution and its independent sub projects, seperately and/or altogther, special considerations had to be made with GitHub repositories I still can't believe had to be done.

We use Subtrees and dynamic reference targeting.

After implementing Git Subtree, verify that all projects can be cloned, built, and referenced correctly, both as part of the parent project (`JSopX.OpenProjectX`) and independently.

---

### Adding a Subtree

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note the use of the `JSopX.WebAPI` & `JSopX.OpenProjectX` Projects are intended as by example.

To add a repository as a subtree, perform the following command, where we will use `Bash` to add `JSopX.WebAPI` as the subtree to the flagship parent solution, `JSopX.OpenProjectX`:

**Using Bash**:

```bash

 # Using Bash: Add JSopX.WebAPI Git Repository As Subtree

 # 1.1. Navigate to the desired local directory where you plan to add 
 # the repository as a subtree.
 cd path\to\local\repo\JasonSilvestri\JSopX.OpenProjectX

 # 1.2. Add JSopX.WebAPI Git Repository Subtree to JSopX.OpenProjectX.       
 git subtree add --prefix=JSopX.OpenProjectX https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master --squash
 
 # -- or --
 
 # 2. Add JSopX.WebAPI Git Repository Subtree to JSopX.OpenProjectX inline.       
 git subtree add --prefix=path/to/local/repo/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.OpenProjectX https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master --squash
 
 # -- For Clarity --

 # 3. If we were not using Subtrees, we would instead clone JSopX.WebAPI Git Repository as we would normally.       
 git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git

```

This command adds the `JSopX.WebAPI` repository as a subtree in the `JSopX.OpenProjectX` repository, under the `path/to/local/repo/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.OpenProjectX` directory.

---

### Pulling in Updates

To pull in updates from the remote subtree repository, use the following command:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix=path/to/local/repo/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master --squash
```

This pulls the latest changes from the `master` branch of the `JSopX.WebAPI` repository and merges them into your local project.

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

### Pushing Subtree Changes

To push changes made in the subtree back to the remote repository, use:

```bash
git subtree push --prefix=path/to/local/repo/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI.git master
```

This command pushes any changes made in the `path/to/local/repo/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI` directory back to the `master` branch of the `JSopX.WebAPI` repository.

---

### Removing a Subtree

If you need to remove a subtree, you can simply delete the directory and clean up the Git history:

```bash
rm -rf path/to/local/repo/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.WebAPI
git add .
git commit -m "Removed JSopX.WebAPI subtree"
```

This will remove the subtree and commit the changes to your repository.

## Removing a Git Subtree (Files Only)

### Remove the Subtree Files from Your Project

To remove a subtree like `JSopX.ClassLibrary` from your parent repo (`JSopX.OpenProjectX`) without altering history, follow these steps. This assumes you’re in the root directory of your local parent repo:

1. **Delete the Subtree Directory**
   Remove the subtree’s files and stage the change:
   ```bash
   git rm -r JSopX.ClassLibrary
   ```

2. **Commit the Removal**
   Commit the change to record the removal:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Removed JSopX.ClassLibrary subtree from project"
   ```

3. **Push the Changes**
   Push the update to your remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```

### Notes
- **History Remains:** If you used `--squash` when adding the subtree, only a single commit is in your history. This method removes the files but leaves that commit intact.
- **Simple Approach:** Use this if you just want the files gone without rewriting history.

## Completely Removing Git Subtrees (Including History)

### Overview
To erase all traces of multiple subtrees (e.g., `JSopX.ClassLibrary`, `JSopX.Utilities`) from your repo’s history, use `git filter-repo`. This rewrites history to remove both files and commits.

### Prerequisites
1. **Install `git-filter-repo`:**
   - macOS/Linux: `brew install git-filter-repo`
   - Windows: `pip install git-filter-repo` or download from [GitHub](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo)
2. **Backup Your Repo:**
   Clone your repo to a safe location before rewriting history:
   ```bash
   git clone --mirror /path/to/JSopX.OpenProjectX /path/to/backup
   ```

### Steps to Remove All Subtree History

1. **Navigate to Your Local Repo**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/JSopX.OpenProjectX
   ```

2. **Identify Subtree Prefixes**
   List all subtree directories to remove (e.g., `JSopX.ClassLibrary`, `JSopX.Utilities`).

3. **Run `git filter-repo` to Remove Subtrees**
   Remove the specified subtrees and their history:
   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path JSopX.ClassLibrary --path JSopX.Utilities --invert-paths --force
   ```
   - `--path`: Targets the subtree directories.
   - `--invert-paths`: Removes those paths.
   - `--force`: Overrides safety checks.

4. **Verify the Result**
   Check that the subtrees and their commits are gone:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

5. **Update the Remote Repository**
   Force-push the rewritten history (warn collaborators!):
   ```bash
   git push origin master --force
   ```

---

### Important Notes
- **Collaboration Impact:** Others will need to rebase or re-clone after the force-push.
- **Multiple Subtrees:** Add all prefixes in one command (e.g., `--path JSopX.ClassLibrary --path JSopX.Utilities`).
- **Undo:** Use your backup if needed.

---

## **Step 3: Manage Circular Project References**

To avoid circular dependencies:

- Place `.sln` files in separate folders from their respective `.csproj` files:
  ```
  ├── JSopX.WebAPI/
  │   ├── JSopX.WebAPI.sln
  │   ├── JSopX.WebAPI/
  │   │   └── JSopX.WebAPI.csproj
  ```

- Use `PathConfig.targets` for consistent reference management.

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Step 4: Clone Projects into Parent Projects**

Clone child projects into parent repositories:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JasonSilvestri/JSopX.ClassLibrary.git
```

Ensure all references are properly added to the parent solution in Visual Studio.

[`Back to Top`](#table-of-contents)

---

## **Step 5: Resolve Dynamic Path Conflicts**

Centralize path configuration using `PathConfig.targets`. Update `.csproj` files to import this configuration for dynamic resolution of references.

### **Step 5.1: Set Up Centralized Reference Path Configuration**
Create `PathConfig.targets` with shared paths:
```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <ClassLibraryPath>..\..\JSopX.ClassLibrary</ClassLibraryPath>
    <WebAPIPath>..\..\JSopX.WebAPI</WebAPIPath>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="$(ClassLibraryPath)\JSopX.ClassLibrary.csproj" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

### **Step 5.2: Update `.csproj` Files**
Import `PathConfig.targets` in each `.csproj` file:
```xml
<Import Project="..\..\PathConfig.targets" Condition="Exists('..\..\PathConfig.targets')" />
```

### **Step 5.3: Add Dynamic Directory Depth Check**
Add logic to adjust paths based on nesting depth:
```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ProjectPathDepth>$([System.String]::Copy($(ProjectPath)).Split('\').Length)</ProjectPathDepth>
</PropertyGroup>
```

### **Step 5.4: Test and Validate**
- Build individual projects and the entire solution.
- Check that directory depth logic resolves references correctly.
