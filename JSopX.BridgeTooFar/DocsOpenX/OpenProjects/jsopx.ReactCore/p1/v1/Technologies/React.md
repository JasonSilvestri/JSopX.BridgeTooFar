## **Overview**  

The JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences _require_ `React` v **`18.2.0`** (_or higher_), and is needed to build JSopX™ projects that utilize React. This version provides a modern, efficient, and flexible way to build user interfaces with reusable components.

Keep your `React` environment is set up with this version to leverage the full power of React in your applications.

This section is dedicated to helping you ensure you have the correct `React` setup, by describing how to check versions, perform installations if necessary, check JSopX™ dependencies, get links to official documentation, and more!

## React: Checking Versions

Check if `React` v **`18.2.0`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Node`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `React` v `18.2.0` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Node`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
2. **Node Command:**
     ```bash
       npm list react
     ```
3. **Expected Output:** 
     ```
       react@18.2.0
     ```
4. **Purpose:** Verifies React version.

These commands check the `version` of `React` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `React` Command Line dialog output.
   
If you have version `React` v **`18.2.0`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have React installed or you version is **`lower`** than `React` v **`18.2.0`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.

## React: Installation:

Install `React` v **`18.2.0`** (_or higher_) if it is not already installed or found on your device.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`Node`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `React` v `18.2.0` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Node`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

2. **Node Command:**
     ```node
       // Using npm:
       // Install React and React DOM
       npm install react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0
     ```
    
3. This command should _install_ all necessary `React` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `React` Command Line dialog output.

## **React: `JSopX.` Project Dependencies**

`JSopX` projects leverages shared resources and code from other projects within the JSopX™ ecosystem. This ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Yeah, well, it also adds dependency.

1. **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`**:
   - The [Flagship Project](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#1-flagship-projects) parent enterprise application solution.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.OpenProjectX](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.OpenProjectX)

2. **`JSopX.SharedResources`**:
   - A [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) that contains reusable static assets, docs, code, and all the source one would want in a development sand box environment, while using a more traditional approach to **Class Libraries**.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.SharedResources](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.SharedResources)
 
3. **`JSopX.RCLxAssets`**:
   - The direct [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) successor of `JSopX.SharedResources` that contains most of the same reusable static assets, docs, code, and all the source, but now instead uses a more modern **Razor Class Library**. 
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.RCLxAssets](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.RCLxAssets)

4. **`JSopX.RCLxProper`**:

This epic [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) Razor Class Library, Combines Razor components with **.NET MAUI** to create cross-platform applications.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.RCLxComponents](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.RCLxComponents)

6. **`JSopX.ReactCore`**:
    - A **React Core** [Client-Side “Existing” Apps Examples](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#5-client-side-existing-apps-examples) project, created to simulate an existing React Core application we are now tasked with migrating into our enterprise application, adopting our standards, API and more.
