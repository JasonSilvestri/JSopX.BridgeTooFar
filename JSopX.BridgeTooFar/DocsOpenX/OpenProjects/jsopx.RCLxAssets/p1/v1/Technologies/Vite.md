## **Overview**  

The JSopX™ Open Project EXperiences _require_ `Vite` v **`5.2.8`** (_or higher_), particularly when using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte. Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool that enhances the development experience with features like instant hot module replacement. 

Ensure you have this version installed to maximize development efficiency.

This section is dedicated to helping you ensure you have the correct `Vite` setup, by describing how to check versions, perform installations if necessary, check JSopX™ dependencies, get links to official documentation, and more!

## Vite: Checking Versions

Check if `Vite` v **`5.2.8`** (_or higher_) is installed on your device.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

Use **`Node`** Command Line dialog to ensure you have the correct version of `Vite` v `5.2.8` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Node`, type the following command, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:
   
2. **Node Command:**
     ```bash
       npm list vite
     ```
3. **Expected Output:** 
     ```
       vite@5.2.8
     ```
4. **Purpose:** Verifies Vite version.

These commands check the `version` of `Vite` on your device, and then prints back your version to the `Vite` Command Line dialog output.
   
If you have version `Vite` v **`5.2.8`** (_or higher_), you are _good to go_, and no further action is needed!
   
If you do not have Vite installed or you version is **`lower`** than `Vite` v **`5.2.8`**, it is recommended that you install it _immediately_ to avoid unexpected results.

## Vite: Installation:

Install `Vite` v **`5.2.8`** (_or higher_) if it is not already installed or found on your device.

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

You can use **`Node`** Command Line dialog again to `install` the correct version of `Vite` v `5.2.8` (_or higher_) on your device.
   
1. Open `Node`, type the following _command_, and hit the `Enter` button on your `keyboard`:

2. **Node Command:**
     ```node
       // Using npm:
       // Install Vite
       npm install vite@5.2.8
      ```
    
3. This command should _install_ all necessary `Vite` dependencies and features, and then prints the results of the installation to the `Vite` Command Line dialog output.

## **Vite: `JSopX.` Project Dependencies**

`JSopX` projects leverages shared resources and code from other projects within the JSopX™ ecosystem. This ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Yeah, well, it also adds dependency.

1. **`JSopX.OpenProjectX`**:
   - The [Flagship Project](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#1-flagship-projects) parent enterprise application solution.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.OpenProjectX](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.OpenProjectX)

2. **`JSopX.SharedResources`**:
   - A [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) that contains reusable static assets, docs, code, and all the source one would want in a development sand box environment, while using a more traditional approach to **Class Libraries**.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.SharedResources](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.SharedResources)
 
3. **`JSopX.RCLxAssets`**:
   - The direct [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) successor of `JSopX.SharedResources` that contains most of the same reusable static assets, docs, code, and all the source, but now instead uses a more modern **Razor Class Library**. 
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.RCLxAssets](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.RCLxAssets)

4. **`JSopX.RCLxProper`**:
   - An extremely light-weight, [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) version of the `JSopX.Assets` Razor Class Library, specifically designed for Production-Ready environments.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.RCLxProper](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.RCLxProper)

5. **`JSopX.RCLxComponents`**:
   - Although there is not much traction is the project as of yet, don't let it fool you. This epic [Shared Assets & Resources Projects](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#2-shared-assets--resources-projects) Razor Class Library, Combines Razor components with **.NET MAUI** to create cross-platform applications.
   - **Explore GitHub**: [JSopX.RCLxComponents](../../../../../OpenProjects/jsopx.RCLxComponents)

6. **`JSopX.VueCore`**:
    - A **Vue Core** [Client-Side “Existing” Apps Examples](../../../../../Introduction/JSopxProjectsFamilies.md#5-client-side-existing-apps-examples) created to simulate an existing Vue Core application we are now tasked with migrating into our enterprise application, adopting our standards, API and more.
